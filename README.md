The comparison of our method with partially aligned multi-view clustering methods PVC, MvCLN, and UPMGC. Since these PVC and MvCLN can only handle two views, we generate two base clustering results for the ensemble for a fair comparison. Figures 1 and 2 in the file "Anonymous.pdf" show the ACC and NMI results with different unaligned ratios. We can see that our method can outperform these methods on most data sets.
